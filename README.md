# Programming-Assignment-4
Programming assigment that deals with Data Wrangling and Data Visualization in this assignment the task is to create different dataframes and visualization from a given dataset. The Dataset is in an excel file and was used for an ECE board exam problem in which the goal was to produce different dataframes that follow a given format and to create a graph visualization that shows the average grade of the students and which factors might affect them.

## 1a. Creating a dataframe based on the given format Vis = [“Name”, “Gender”, “Track”, “Math<70”]; hometown is constant as Visayas. Content of the dataframe to be made should be Name, Grades for GEAS, and Grades for Electronics that are greater than 70.
- In this problem the first step was to set a dataframe named Instru which has specifications and conditions for the Hometown which is Luzon, The track which is Instrumentation, and the Grade in electronics being greater than 70. Next was to set another dataframe which only includes the given which was Name, Grades for GEAS, and Grades for Electronics that are greater than 70. The last step was to print and display the Dataframe

## 1b. Creating a dataframe based on the given format Vis = [“Name”, “Gender”, “Track”, “Math<70”]; hometown is constant as Visayas. Content of the dataframe to be made should be Name, Track, and Grades for Electronics, and Average Grade for all subjects.
- In this problem the first step was to set a dataframe named average which includes the average grade for all of the subjects of every student. Next was set a dataframe named Mindy which has specifications and conditions given which is Mindanao as hometown, Female as gender, and the average grade is greater than or equal to 55. Next was to set another dataframe which only includes the given that follows the format which was Name, Track, Electronics, and average. The last step was to print and display the Dataframe

## 2. Creating a data visualization that includes the following; chosen track in college, gender, or hometown and see if any of them contributes to getting a higher score. A box plot was chosen here to make the visualization of the outliers easier. The matplotlib and seaborn libraries were used for the visualisation. In this problem The first step was to import new libraries which were matplotlib and seaborn; next was to set the figure size or the size of the visualization/graph; next was to set which type of graph, which dataframe to be used and the parameters set for the x and y axis alongside the specifications for the colors in the graph. After that labels were set for the both of the axis and for the name of the graph itself.
